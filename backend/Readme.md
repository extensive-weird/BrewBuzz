# â˜• BrewBuzz Backend

BrewBuzz is the backend server for a full-stack coffee shop platform designed to connect local cafÃ©s with their customers. Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **PostgreSQL**, this API handles user authentication, business management, reviews, cart operations, and ordering. It also integrates with the **Clover POS system** and **AWS S3** to streamline business operations and file handling.

This backend was designed with one goal in mind: **to give peace of mind to coffee shop owners** by eliminating the hassle of manually updating menus. Instead, BrewBuzz fetches real-time data directly from Clover, ensuring the menu shown in the app is always up to date.
